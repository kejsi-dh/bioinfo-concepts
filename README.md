# Bioinformatics Concepts
Different Bioinformatics algorithms, made using Python. The algorithms include:
* **Gotoh Algorithm**: Taking after the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, it is used for pairwise global sequence alignment and specifically designed to handle affine gap penalties
* **Center Star Algorithm**: A 2-approximation for the sum-of-pairs distance multiple alignment problem (prints the distance matrix, the center string, and the Multiple Sequence Alignment using the center string)
* **UPGMA**: A straightforward approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree from a distance matrix, and it requires the assumption that the input is an ultrametric tree
* **Shortest Common Superstring**: Taking two sequences, the shortest sequence which has these sequences as subsequences is to be found
* **De-Bruijn Graphs**: Taking a set of reads, DBG is a directed graph which represents overlaps between sequences of these reads
* **Local Search Sorting**
* **Median Graph**: An undirected graph in which every three vertices have a unique median, which is a vertex that belongs to shortest paths between each pair of the three vertices
* **Median String**: A popular algorithm to to find DNA consensus
* **Random Forests for GRN Inference**: Utilizing random sampling and ensemble strategies in random forests, enable it to achieve accurate predictions as well as better generalizations for, in this case, GRN specifically
