# Bioinformatics Concepts
Different Bioinformatics algorithms, made using Python. The algorithms include:
* **Gotoh Algorithm**: Taking after the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, it is used for pairwise global sequence alignment and specifically designed to handle affine gap penalties
* **Center Star Algorithm**: A 2-approximation for the sum-of-pairs distance multiple alignment problem (prints the distance matrix, the center string, and the Multiple Sequence Alignment using the center string)
